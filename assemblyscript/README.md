## AssemblyScript Path Finder module

The module consists of two parts. The first part find the shortest path in 3-dimensional navigation mesh. The second part use RVO2 algorithm for collision avoidance. These two parts can be used as separately, as together in one ```PathFinder``` object. This complex ```PathFinder``` object control the agents movements in the navigation mesh. The user only set the destination points for each agent, and the module executes the other routine. RVO simulations use two dimensions (x and z), while navigation mesh is three-dimensional. In ```RVOSimulator``` all agent positions are projected into xz-plane.

### Creation API

* ```create_pathfinder(vertices: Float32Array | null, polygons: Int32Array | null, sizes: Int32Array | null): PathFinder```

	Create the ```PathFinder``` object. Inputs are plain arrays with navigation mesh vertices coordinates and polygonal descriptions. If one of arrays is ```null``` then the object will be created only with ```RVOSimulator``` component on infinite XZ-plane.
	
	Polygons on the navigation mesh should be convex. Each polygon defined by the sequence of it vertex indexes. This sequence should be define the orientation of the polygon opposite to the orientation from OX axis to OZ axis.
	
	The next example demonstrate arrays that define 6-gon as two 4-sided polygons:
	
	```
	let vertices = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0,   // the first vertex
			 0.5, 0.0, -1.0,  // the second vertex
			 -0.5, 0.0, -1.0, // and so on
			 -1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
			 -0.5, 0.0, 1.0,
			 0.5, 0.0, 1.0];
	let polygons = [0, 1, 2, 3,  // the first polygon
			 0, 3, 4, 5]; //the second polygon
	let sizes = [4, 4];  // because both polygons are 4-sided
	```

* ```create_pathfinder_ext(vertices: Float32Array | null, polygons: Int32Array | null, sizes: Int32Array | null, neighbor_dist: f32, max_neighbors: i32, time_horizon: f32, time_horizon_obst: f32, agent_radius: f32, update_path_find: f32, continuous_moving: bool, move_agents: bool, snap_agents: bool, use_normals: bool): PathFinder```

	More complex version of the previous command. Allows detail setup of the ```RVOSimulator``` subcomponents and parameters of agent movement routine. If navigation mash data is not ```null``` then the boundary edges of the navmesh will be used as obstacles in each ```RVOSimulator```. These simulators will create for each connected component of the navmesh.

    * ```neighbor_dist```: the maximum distance to other agents a new agent takes into account in the simulation
    * ```max_neighbors```: the maximum number of other agents a new agent takes into account in the simulation
	* ```time_horizon```: the minimal amount of time for which a new agent's velocities that are computed by the simulation are safe with respect to other agents. The larger this number, the sooner an agent will respond to the presence of other agents, but the less freedom the agent has in choosing its velocities
	* ```time_horizon_obst```: the minimal amount of time for which a new agent's velocities that are computed by the simulation are safe with respect to obstacles. The larger this number, the sooner an agent will respond to the presence of obstacles, but the less freedom the agent has in choosing its velocities
	* ```agent_radius```: this value is used for constructing obstacle edges in ```RVOSimulator``` objects. Each edge is shifted from corresponding navmesh boundary edge at negative direction by this value
	* ```update_path_find```: the amount of time between recalculations of move paths for agents
	* ```continuous_moving```: if ```true``` then agents go to the final destination point every time, even it already has reached it. If other agent shift the agent from it final position, then it will return to the final destination
	* ```move_agents```: if ```true``` then agents will change it positions during the simulation. If ```false``` then the system will only calculate it velocities, but does not change positions
	* ```snap_agents```: if ```true``` then each update call all agents will snap to the closest point in the navigation mesh. If this value is ```false``` and the navigation mesh is not planar, then the height position of agents linear interpolated between points in the path. Also, when ```snap_agents = false```, one agent can shift the other agent outside of the navigation mesh. In this case the shifted agent will not move, because it fails to find the path to the destination point. These undesired shifts can be eliminated by properly defined ```agent_radius``` value. So, if ```snap_agents = true``` then the system is stable but less performance, if ```snap_agents = false``` then calculations are more performance, but the system is not stable in some cases
	* ```use_normals```: if ```true``` then during projections into xz-plane, proportionally change agent speeds so, that it move slowly on more steep slope

* ```create_navmesh(vertices: Float32Array, polygons: Int32Array, sizes: Int32Array): Navmesh```

	Create ```RVOSimulator``` on infinite XZ-plane. You can add obstacles to this simulator by using it API. All parameters are the same as on extended ```PathFinder``` creation command.
	* ```max_speed```: maximal speed of an agent.

* ```function create_graph(vertex_positions: Float32Array, vertices: Int32Array, edges: Int32Array): Graph```

	Create ```Graph``` object.
	* ```vertex_positions```: plain array with 3-dimensional coordinates of graph vertices
	* ```vertices```: unique identifications of vertices (it names)
	* ```edges```: plain array with pairs of vertices names. The first two value define the first edge of the graph, the third and froth values - the second edge and so on

## Performance comparison

### Search the shortest path algorithm

For benchmarks we use the following map:

<img src="../images/map_00.png" width="400" />

This navigation mesh contains 2 294 polygons. We compare our WASM implementation and Recast Navigation library (which is c++, but we will use Python bindings [PyRecastDetour](https://github.com/Tugcga/PyRecastDetour)). For benchmark we generate some random pair of points and calculate the path between these points. The results in the table:

Task | WASM | PyRecastDetour
--- | --- | ---
Initialization time | 0.05 sec | 0.02 sec
1024 pairs | 0.15 sec | 0.08 sec
4096 pairs | 0.48 sec | 0.28 sec
16 384 pairs | 2.01 sec | 1.24 sec
38 416 pairs | 4.62 sec | 2.69 sec
65 536 pairs | 7.79 sec | 4.59 sec
147 456 pairs | 17.52 sec | 10.20 sec

So, our WASM version is nearly x1.7 times slowly with respect to c++ solution.


### Collision avoidance algorithm

For benchmark we simply generate a number of agents on the plane, set destination point at the center and make several simulation steps. We compare our WASM implementation (as as-RVO), compilation of the [RVO2 library](https://github.com/snape/RVO2) into [WebAssembly by Emscripten](https://github.com/Tugcga/RVO2-Emscripten) (as em-RVO) and Python bindings of the c++ version of the RVO2 library (as c-RVO).

Task | as-RVO | em-RVO | c-RVO
--- | --- | --- | ---
1000 agents, 1000 steps | 16.1 sec | 9.45 sec | 3.01 sec
100 000 agents, 1 step | 3.42 sec | 2.19 sec | 0.51 sec

So, Emscripten version is x1.6 times faster, c++ version is x6 times faster.


## Example application

[Here](https://playcanv.as/p/MID4JNwZ/) is a simple Playcanvas application, which demonstrates the basic possibilities of the module. This application contains three different scenes.

The first scene demonstrate the path finding algorithm and snapping of the agent to the navigation mesh.

<img src="../images/pc_scene_01.png" width="400" />

The second scene demonstrate the simple case of the using RVO2 algorithm. A number of agents move in the plane to the common destination point and avoid collisions.

<img src="../images/pc_scene_02.png" width="400" />

The third scene demonstrate the complex usage of the path finding and collision avoidance. A number of agents moves on navigation mesh to random destination points.
